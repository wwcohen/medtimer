Working app


To do:
 - push to git - probably need a new token?
 - sounds are too quiet?
 - spinners not text fields?
 - should keep a log
   - days  used [#used] / [#since installed] 
   - hours here [#this app] total [#total]
   - average time [minutes / day]

To test current app:
 - start (play button in device manager) pixel 7 pro emulator in Android Studio app
 - "% npx react-native start" in one window
 - "% npx react-native run-android" in a second
